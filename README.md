# algo.js

_Dec, 12<sup>th</sup>, 2013_

I am starting to migrate algo.js from [Google Code] [4].

This is a project containing implementation of some algorithms in `JavaScript`. I use [QUnit] [1] for unit test, and [Blanket.js] [2] for code coverage.

I try to introduce some OOP into this project, and recently, I am learning functional programming like `Scala`, so that I also try to introduce the functional conception. So we will see `.map()`, `.forEach()`, etc. Fortunately, we have some iteration methods for Array in [ECMA-262, Edition 5] [3].

This project is not the best implementation, but I am taking it easier to use.

Read __wiki__ page for details including API of this. However, the API docs are slower than the codes, which you can browse from repo directly.
